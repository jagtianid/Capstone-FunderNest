Mission: To help HackerNest but more specifically, DementiaHack with donating items for those struggling with Dementia.

Our working component of our prototype system is based on the 'expiredBids' use case. This is built specifically for the administrator. This prototype will display bids that have been closed/expired.  

This procedure will be a more effective approach to convey people to donate for a worthy cause.
