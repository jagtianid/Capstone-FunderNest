Mission: To help HackerNest but more specifically, DementiaHack with donating items for those struggling with Dementia.

Our working component of our prototype system is based on the 'auction' use case. This is very significant for HackerNest because donators have an option to either place their bid on a current item or they can add any item to the list. 

This procedure will be a more effective approach to convey people to donate for a worthy cause.
